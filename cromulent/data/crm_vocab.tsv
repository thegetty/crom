E1_CRM_Entity	class	CRMEntity	CRM Entity	This class comprises all things in the universe of discourse of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model. \nIt is an abstract concept providing for three general properties:\n1. Identification by name or appellation, and in particular by a preferred identifier\n2. Classification by type, allowing further refinement of the specific subclass an instance belongs to \n3. Attachment of free text for the expression of anything not captured by formal properties\nWith the exception of E59 Primitive Value, all other classes within the CRM are directly or indirectly specialisations of E1 CRM Entity.		0
E2_Temporal_Entity	class	TemporalEntity	Temporal Entity	This class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods, E5 Events and states, which happen over a limited extent in time. \n In some contexts, these are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item. This is an abstract class and has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.	E1_CRM_Entity	0
E3_Condition_State	class	ConditionState	Condition State	This class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span. \nAn instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or feature during a specific E52 Time Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held.\n The nature of that condition can be described using P2 has type. For example, the E3 Condition State “condition of the SS Great Britain between 22 September 1846 and 27 August 1847” can be characterized as E55 Type “wrecked”.	E2_Temporal_Entity	0
E4_Period	class	Period	Period	This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the "ground" or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\n\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the "Neolithic Period", the "Ming Dynasty" or the "McCarthy Era", but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nAs the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\n\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\n\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the  timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least  one area.\n\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a space-time volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of 'artistic style', defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.

E5_Event	class	Event	Event	This class comprises changes of states in cultural, social or physical systems, regardless of scale, brought about by a series or group of coherent physical, cultural, technological or legal phenomena. Such changes of state will affect instances of E77 Persistent Item or its subclasses.\nThe distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is partly a question of the scale of observation. Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an ‘instantaneous’ change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy change of state.	E4_Period	2
E6_Destruction	class	Destruction	Destruction	This class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.  \nSome destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an E6 Destruction and E7 Activity. \nThe decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive: \n1.  If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as E6 Destruction. \n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as E11 Modification.	E64_End_of_Existence	0
E7_Activity	class	Activity	Activity	This class comprises actions intentionally carried out by instances of E39 Actor that result in changes of state in the cultural, social, or physical systems documented. \nThis notion includes complex, composite and long-lasting actions such as the building of a settlement or a war, as well as simple, short-lived actions such as the opening of a door.	E5_Event	1
E8_Acquisition	class	Acquisition	Acquisition	This class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more other instances of E39 Actor. \nThe class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of right. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:\n1. the beginning of ownership\n2. the end of ownership\n3. the transfer of ownership\n4. the acquisition from an unknown source \n5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item\nIt may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.	E7_Activity	1
E9_Move	class	Move	Move	This class comprises changes of the physical location of the instances of E19 Physical Object. \nNote, that the class E9 Move inherits the property P7 took place at (witnessed): E53 Place. This property should be used to describe the trajectory or a larger area within which a move takes place, whereas the properties P26 moved to (was destination of), P27 moved from (was origin of) describe the start and end points only. Moves may also be documented to consist of other moves (via P9 consists of (forms part of)), in order to describe intermediate stages on a trajectory. In that case, start and end points of the partial moves should match appropriately between each other and with the overall event.	E7_Activity	2
E10_Transfer_of_Custody	class	TransferOfCustody	Transfer of Custody	This class comprises transfers of physical custody of objects between instances of E39 Actor. \nThe recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances it may describe:\n1. the beginning of custody \n2. the end of custody \n3. the transfer of custody \n4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source\n5. the declared loss of an object\nThe distinction between the legal responsibility for custody and the actual physical possession of the object should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). A specific case of transfer of custody is theft.\nThe interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.	E7_Activity	1
E11_Modification	class	Modification	Modification	This class comprises all instances of E7 Activity that create, alter or change E24 Physical Man-Made Thing. \nThis class includes the production of an item from raw materials, and other so far undocumented objects, and the preventive treatment or restoration of an object for conservation. \nSince the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in a Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities. \nIf the instance of the E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.	E7_Activity	2
E12_Production	class	Production	Production	This class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items. \nIt specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. \nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. \nAn event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.	E11_Modification|E63_Beginning_of_Existence	1
E13_Attribute_Assignment	class	AttributeAssignment	Attribute Assignment	This class comprises the actions of making assertions about properties of an object or any relation between two items or concepts. \nThis class allows the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as "short cuts" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules. \nIn particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.	E7_Activity	1
E14_Condition_Assessment	class	ConditionAssessment	Condition Assessment	This class describes the act of assessing the state of preservation of an object during a particular period. \nThe condition assessment may be carried out by inspection, measurement or through historical research. This class is used to document circumstances of the respective assessment that may be relevant to interpret its quality at a later stage, or to continue research on related documents.	E13_Attribute_Assignment	0
E15_Identifier_Assignment	class	IdentifierAssignment	Identifier Assignment	This class comprises activities that result in the allocation of an identifier to an instance of E1 CRM Entity. An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.	E13_Attribute_Assignment	0
E16_Measurement	class	Measurement	Measurement	This class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic procedure. \nExamples include measuring the monetary value of a collection of coins or the running time of a specific video cassette. \nThe E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Details of methods and devices are best handled as free text, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon 14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of:) E55 Type.	E13_Attribute_Assignment	0
E17_Type_Assignment	class	TypeAssignment	Type Assignment	This class comprises the actions of classifying items of whatever kind. Such items include objects, specimens, people, actions and concepts. \nThis class allows for the documentation of the context of classification acts in cases where the value of the classification depends on the personal opinion of the classifier, and the date that the classification was made. This class also encompasses the notion of "determination," i.e. the systematic and molecular identification of a specimen in biology.	E13_Attribute_Assignment	0
E18_Physical_Thing	class	PhysicalThing	Physical Thing	This class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, man-made or natural.\n\nDepending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.\n\nAn instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.\n\nWe model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThe CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.	E72_Legal_Object|E92_Spacetime_Volume	0
E19_Physical_Object	class	PhysicalObject	Physical Object	This class comprises items of a material nature that are units for documentation and have physical boundaries that separate them completely in an objective way from other objects. \nThe class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessmen. Typically, instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).\nIn some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called “bona fide objects” (Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), i.e. naturally defined objects. \nThe decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be a purely administrative decision or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.	E18_Physical_Thing	0
E20_Biological_Object	class	BiologicalObject	Biological Object	This class comprises individual items of a material nature, which live, have lived or are natural products of or from living organisms. \nArtificial objects that incorporate biological elements, such as Victorian butterfly frames, can be documented as both instances of E20 Biological Object and E22 Man-Made Object.	E19_Physical_Object	0
E21_Person	class	Person	Person	This class comprises real persons who live or are assumed to have lived. \nLegendary figures that may have existed, such as Ulysses and King Arthur, fall into this class if the documentation refers to them as historical figures. In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity.	E20_Biological_Object|E39_Actor	1
E22_Man-Made_Object	class	ManMadeObject	Man-Made Object	This class comprises physical objects purposely created by human activity.\nNo assumptions are made as to the extent of modification required to justify regarding an object as man-made. For example, an inscribed piece of rock or a preserved butterfly are both regarded as instances of E22 Man-Made Object.	E19_Physical_Object|E24_Physical_Man-Made_Thing	1
E24_Physical_Man-Made_Thing	class	PhysicalManMadeThing	Physical Man-Made Thing	This class comprises all persistent physical items that are purposely created by human activity.\nThis class comprises man-made objects, such as a swords, and man-made features, such as rock art. No assumptions are made as to the extent of modification required to justify regarding an object as man-made. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing.	E18_Physical_Thing|E71_Man-Made_Thing	0
E25_Man-Made_Feature	class	ManMadeFeature	Man-Made Feature	This class comprises physical features that are purposely created by human activity, such as scratches, artificial caves, artificial water channels, etc. \nNo assumptions are made as to the extent of modification required to justify regarding a feature as man-made. For example, rock art or even “cup and ring” carvings on bedrock a regarded as types of E25 Man-Made Feature.	E24_Physical_Man-Made_Thing|E26_Physical_Feature	0
E26_Physical_Feature	class	PhysicalFeature	Physical Feature	This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects. \nInstances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not. \nInstances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature. \nThis definition coincides with the definition of "fiat objects" (Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”.	E18_Physical_Thing	0
E27_Site	class	Site	Site	This class comprises pieces of land or sea floor. \nIn contrast to the purely geometric notion of E53 Place, this class describes constellations of matter on the surface of the Earth or other celestial body, which can be represented by photographs, paintings and maps.\n Instances of E27 Site are composed of relatively immobile material items and features in a particular configuration at a particular location	E26_Physical_Feature	0
E28_Conceptual_Object	class	ConceptualObject	Conceptual Object	This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that   have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation or historical   implication. The production of such information may have been supported by the use of      technical devices such as cameras or computers.\nCharacteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.\nThey cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.	E71_Man-Made_Thing	0
E29_Design_or_Procedure	class	DesignOrProcedure	Design or Procedure	This class comprises documented plans for the execution of actions in order to achieve a result of a specific quality, form or contents. In particular it comprises plans for deliberate human activities that may result in the modification or production of instances of E24 Physical Thing. \nInstances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on others. This is modelled using P69 has association with (is associated with). \nDesigns or procedures can be seen as one of the following:\n1. A schema for the activities it describes\n2. A schema of the products that result from their application. \n3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s famous plans for flying machines.\nBecause designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CRM models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.	E73_Information_Object	0
E30_Right	class	Right	Right	This class comprises legal privileges concerning material and immaterial things or their derivatives. \nThese include reproduction and property rights	E89_Propositional_Object	1
E31_Document	class	Document	Document	This class comprises identifiable immaterial items that make propositions about reality.\nThese propositions may be expressed in text, graphics, images, audiograms, videograms or by other similar means. Documentation databases are regarded as a special case of E31 Document. This class should not be confused with the term “document” in Information Technology, which is compatible with E73 Information Object.	E73_Information_Object	0
E32_Authority_Document	class	AuthorityDocument	Authority Document	This class comprises encyclopaedia, thesauri, authority lists and other documents that define terminology or conceptual systems for consistent use.	E31_Document	0
E33_Linguistic_Object	class	LinguisticObject	Linguistic Object	This class comprises identifiable expressions in natural language or languages. \nInstances of E33 Linguistic Object can be expressed in many ways: e.g. as written texts, recorded speech or sign language. However, the CRM treats instances of E33 Linguistic Object independently from the medium or method by which they are expressed. Expressions in formal languages, such as computer code or mathematical formulae, are not treated as instances of E33 Linguistic Object by the CRM. These should be modelled as instances of E73 Information Object.\nThe text of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object can be documented in a note by P3 has note: E62 String	E73_Information_Object	1
E34_Inscription	class	Inscription	Inscription	This class comprises recognisable, short texts attached to instances of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing. \nThe transcription of the text can be documented in a note by P3 has note: E62 String. The alphabet used can be documented by P2 has type: E55 Type. This class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of an inscription, but the underlying prototype. The physical embodiment is modelled in the CRM as E24 Physical Man-Made Thing.\nThe relationship of a physical copy of a book to the text it contains is modelled using E84 Information Carrier. P128 carries (is carried by): E33 Linguistic Object.	E33_Linguistic_Object|E37_Mark	0
E35_Title	class	Title	Title	This class comprises the names assigned to works, such as texts, artworks or pieces of music. \nTitles are proper noun phrases or verbal phrases, and should not be confused with generic object names such as “chair”, “painting” or “book” (the latter are common nouns that stand for instances of E55 Type). Titles may be assigned by the creator of the work itself, or by a social group. \nThis class also comprises the translations of titles that are used as surrogates for the original titles in different social contexts.	E33_Linguistic_Object|E41_Appellation	0
E36_Visual_Item	class	VisualItem	Visual Item	This class comprises the intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks and images.\nThis class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support. \nThe class E36 Visual Item provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks or images etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Man-Made Thing and depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a short-cut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.	E73_Information_Object	1
E37_Mark	class	Mark	Mark	This class comprises symbols, signs, signatures or short texts applied to instances of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing by arbitrary techniques in order to indicate the creator, owner, dedications, purpose, etc. \nThis class specifically excludes features that have no semantic significance, such as scratches or tool marks. These should be documented as instances of E25 Man-Made Feature.	E36_Visual_Item	0
E38_Image	class	Image	Image	This class comprises distributions of form, tone and colour that may be found on surfaces such as photos, paintings, prints and sculptures or directly on electronic media. \nThe degree to which variations in the distribution of form and colour affect the identity of an instance of E38 Image depends on a given purpose. The original painting of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre may be said to bear the same instance of E38 Image as reproductions in the form of transparencies, postcards, posters or T-shirts, even though they may differ in size and carrier and may vary in tone and colour. The images in a “spot the difference” competition are not the same with respect to their context, however similar they may at first appear.	E36_Visual_Item	0
E39_Actor	class	Actor	Actor	This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which someone may be held responsible.\nThe CRM does not attempt to model the inadvertent actions of such actors. Individual people should be documented as instances of E21 Person, whereas groups should be documented as instances of either E74 Group or its subclass E40 Legal Body.	E77_Persistent_Item	1
E40_Legal_Body	class	LegalBody	Legal Body	This class comprises institutions or groups of people that have obtained a legal recognition as a group and can act collectively as agents.  \nThis means that they can perform actions, own property, create or destroy things and can be held collectively responsible for their actions like individual people. The term 'personne morale' is often used for this in French.	E74_Group	0
E41_Appellation	class	Appellation	Appellation	This class comprises signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class or category within a certain context.\nInstances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but instead by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes. \nSpecific subclasses of E41 Appellation should be used when instances of E41 Appellation of a characteristic form are used for particular objects. Instances of E49 Time Appellation, for example, which take the form of instances of E50 Date, can be easily recognised.\nE41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment	E90_Symbolic_Object	0
E42_Identifier	class	Identifier	Identifier	This class comprises strings or codes assigned to instances of E1 CRM Entity in order to identify them uniquely and permanently within the context of one or more organisations. Such codes are often known as inventory numbers, registration codes, etc. and are typically composed of alphanumeric sequences. The class E42 Identifier is not normally used for machine-generated identifiers used for automated processing unless these are also used by human agents.	E41_Appellation	1
E44_Place_Appellation	class	PlaceAppellation	Place Appellation	This class comprises any sort of identifier characteristically used to refer to an E53 Place. \nInstances of E44 Place Appellation may vary in their degree of precision and their meaning may vary over time - the same instance of E44 Place Appellation may be used to refer to several places, either because of cultural shifts, or because objects used as reference points have moved around. Instances of E44 Place Appellation can be extremely varied in form: postal addresses, instances of E47 Spatial Coordinate, and parts of buildings can all be considered as instances of E44 Place Appellation.	E41_Appellation	0
E45_Address	class	Address	Address	This class comprises identifiers expressed in coding systems for places, such as postal addresses used for mailing.\nAn E45 Address can be considered both as the name of an E53 Place and as an E51 Contact Point for an E39 Actor. This dual aspect is reflected in the multiple inheritance. However, some forms of mailing addresses, such as a postal box, are only instances of E51 Contact Point, since they do not identify any particular Place. These should not be documented as instances of E45 Address.	E44_Place_Appellation|E51_Contact_Point	0
E46_Section_Definition	class	SectionDefinition	Section Definition	This class comprises areas of objects referred to in terms specific to the general geometry or structure of its kind. \nThe 'prow' of the boat, the 'frame' of the picture, the 'front' of the building are all instances of E46 Section Definition. The class highlights the fact that parts of objects can be treated as locations. This holds in particular for features without natural boundaries, such as the “head” of a marble statue made out of one block (cf. E53 Place). In answer to the question 'where is the signature?' one might reply 'on the lower left corner'. (Section Definition is closely related to the term “segment” in Gerstl, P.& Pribbenow, S, 1996 “ A conceptual theory of part – whole relations and its applications”, Data & Knowledge  Engineering 20 305-322, North Holland- Elsevier ).	E44_Place_Appellation	0
E47_Spatial_Coordinates	class	SpatialCoordinates	Spatial Coordinates	This class comprises the textual or numeric information required to locate specific instances of E53 Place within schemes of spatial identification. \n\nCoordinates are a specific form of E44 Place Appellation, that is, a means of referring to a particular E53 Place. Coordinates are not restricted to longitude, latitude and altitude. Any regular system of reference that maps onto an E19 Physical Object can be used to generate coordinates.	E44_Place_Appellation	0
E48_Place_Name	class	PlaceName	Place Name	This class comprises particular and common forms of E44 Place Appellation. \nPlace Names may change their application over time: the name of an E53 Place may change, and a name may be reused for a different E53 Place. Instances of E48 Place Name are typically subject to place name gazetteers.	E44_Place_Appellation	0
E49_Time_Appellation	class	TimeAppellation	Time Appellation	This class comprises all forms of names or codes, such as historical periods, and dates, which are characteristically used to refer to a specific E52 Time-Span. \nThe instances of E49 Time Appellation may vary in their degree of precision, and they may be relative to other time frames, “Before Christ” for example. Instances of E52 Time-Span are often defined by reference to a cultural period or an event e.g. ‘the duration of the Ming Dynasty’.	E41_Appellation	0
E50_Date	class	Date	Date	This class comprises specific forms of E49 Time Appellation.	E49_Time_Appellation	0
E51_Contact_Point	class	ContactPoint	Contact Point	This class comprises identifiers employed, or understood, by communication services to direct communications to an instance of E39 Actor. These include E-mail addresses, telephone numbers, post office boxes, Fax numbers, URLs etc. Most postal addresses can be considered both as instances of E44 Place Appellation and E51 Contact Point. In such cases the subclass E45 Address should be used. \nURLs are addresses used by machines to access another machine through an http request. Since the accessed machine acts on behalf of the E39 Actor providing the machine, URLs are considered as instances of E51 Contact Point to that E39 Actor.	E41_Appellation	0
E52_Time-Span	class	TimeSpan	Time-Span	This class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end and a duration. \nTime Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation. \nSince our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely.  An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known. \n Automatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.	E1_CRM_Entity	1
E53_Place	class	Place	Place	This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. \nThe instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.\n It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a "section" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.	E1_CRM_Entity	1
E54_Dimension	class	Dimension	Dimension	This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values etc.\nAn instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from its numerical approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.	E1_CRM_Entity	1
E55_Type	class	Type	Type	This class comprises concepts denoted by terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to characterize and classify instances of CRM classes. Instances of E55 Type represent concepts  in contrast to instances of E41 Appellation which are used to name instances of CRM classes. \nE55 Type is the CRM’s interface to domain specific ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CRM as subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of E55 Type linked via P127 has broader  term (has narrower term). Such hierarchies may be extended with additional properties.	E28_Conceptual_Object	1
E56_Language	class	Language	Language	This class is a specialization of E55 Type and comprises the natural languages in the sense of concepts. \nThis type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model does not foresee the description of instances of instances of E56 Language, e.g.: “instances of  Mandarin Chinese”.\nIt is recommended that internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminology are used to denote instances of E56 Language, such as those defined in ISO 639:1988.	E55_Type	1
E57_Material	class	Material	Material	This class is a specialization of E55 Type and comprises the concepts of materials. \nInstances of E57 Material may denote properties of matter before its use, during its use, and as incorporated in an object, such as ultramarine powder, tempera paste, reinforced concrete. Discrete pieces of raw-materials kept in museums, such as bricks, sheets of fabric, pieces of metal, should be modelled individually in the same way as other objects. Discrete used or processed pieces, such as the stones from Nefer Titi's temple, should be modelled as parts (cf. P46 is composed of).\nThis type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model does not foresee the description of instances of instances of E57 Material, e.g.: “instances of  gold”.\nIt is recommended that internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminology are used.	E55_Type	1
E58_Measurement_Unit	class	MeasurementUnit	Measurement Unit	This class is a specialization of E55 Type and comprises the types of measurement units: feet, inches, centimetres, litres, lumens, etc. \nThis type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model does not foresee the description of instances of instances of E58 Measurement Unit, e.g.: “instances of cm”.\nSyst?me International (SI) units or internationally recognized non-SI terms should be used whenever possible. (ISO 1000:1992). Archaic Measurement Units used in historical records should be preserved.	E55_Type	1
E63_Beginning_of_Existence	class	BeginningOfExistence	Beginning of Existence	This class comprises events that bring into existence any E77 Persistent Item. \nIt may be used for temporal reasoning about things (intellectual products, physical items, groups of people, living beings) beginning to exist; it serves as a hook for determination of a terminus post quem and ante quem.	E5_Event	1
E64_End_of_Existence	class	EndOfExistence	End of Existence	This class comprises events that end the existence of any E77 Persistent Item. \nIt may be used for temporal reasoning about things (physical items, groups of people, living beings) ceasing to exist; it serves as a hook for determination of a terminus postquem and antequem. In cases where substance from a Persistent Item continues to exist in a new form, the process would be documented by E81 Transformation.	E5_Event	1
E65_Creation	class	Creation	Creation	This class comprises events that result in the creation of conceptual items or immaterial products, such as legends, poems, texts, music, images, movies, laws, types etc.	E7_Activity|E63_Beginning_of_Existence	1
E66_Formation	class	Formation	Formation	This class comprises events that result in the formation of a formal or informal E74 Group of people, such as a club, society, association, corporation or nation. \nE66 Formation does not include the arbitrary aggregation of people who do not act as a collective.\nThe formation of an instance of E74 Group does not require that the group is populated with members at the time of formation. In order to express the joining of members at the time of formation, the respective activity should be simultaneously an instance of both E66 Formation and E85 Joining.	E7_Activity|E63_Beginning_of_Existence	1
E67_Birth	class	Birth	Birth	This class comprises the births of human beings. E67 Birth is a biological event focussing on the context of people coming into life. (E63 Beginning of Existence comprises the coming into life of any living beings). \nTwins, triplets etc. are brought into life by the same E67 Birth event. The introduction of the E67 Birth event as a documentation element allows the description of a range of family relationships in a simple model. Suitable extensions may describe more details and the complexity of motherhood with the intervention of modern medicine. In this model, the biological father is not seen as a necessary participant in the E67 Birth event.	E63_Beginning_of_Existence	0
E68_Dissolution	class	Dissolution	Dissolution	This class comprises the events that result in the formal or informal termination of an E74 Group of people. \nIf the dissolution was deliberate, the Dissolution event should also be instantiated as an E7 Activity.	E64_End_of_Existence	0
E69_Death	class	Death	Death	This class comprises the deaths of human beings. \nIf a person is killed, their death should be instantiated as E69 Death and as E7 Activity. The death or perishing of other living beings should be documented using E64 End of Existence.	E64_End_of_Existence	0
E70_Thing	class	Thing	Thing	This general class comprises discrete, identifiable, instances of E77 Persistent Item that are documented as single units, that either consist of matter or depend on being carried by matter and are characterized by relative stability.\nThey may be intellectual products or physical things. They may for instance have a solid physical form, an electronic encoding, or they may be a logical concept or structure.	E77_Persistent_Item	0
E71_Man-Made_Thing	class	ManMadeThing	Man-Made Thing	This class comprises discrete, identifiable man-made items that are documented as single units. \nThese items are either intellectual products or man-made physical things, and are characterized by relative stability. They may for instance have a solid physical form, an electronic encoding, or they may be logical concepts or structures.	E70_Thing	0
E72_Legal_Object	class	LegalObject	Legal Object	This class comprises those material or immaterial items to which instances of E30 Right, such as the right of ownership or use, can be applied. \nThis is true for all E18 Physical Thing. In the case of instances of E28 Conceptual Object, however, the identity of the E28 Conceptual Object or the method of its use may be too ambiguous to reliably establish instances of E30 Right, as in the case of taxa and inspirations. Ownership of corporations is currently regarded as out of scope of the CRM.	E70_Thing	0
E73_Information_Object	class	InformationObject	Information Object	This class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as a poems, jokes, data sets, images, texts, multimedia objects, procedural prescriptions, computer program code, algorithm or mathematical formulae, that have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. The encoding structure known as a "named graph" also falls under this class, so that each "named graph" is an instance of an E73 Information Object. \nAn E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. \nInstances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a reproducible expression.	E89_Propositional_Object|E90_Symbolic_Object	1
E74_Group	class	Group	Group	This class comprises any gatherings or organizations of E39 Actors that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the Group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.\nA gathering of people becomes an E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modeled as membership in an E74 Group (cf. HumanML markup). Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.	E39_Actor	1
E75_Conceptual_Object_Appellation	class	ConceptualObjectAppellation	Conceptual Object Appellation	This class comprises appellations that are by their form or syntax specific to identifying instances of E28 Conceptual Object, such as intellectual products, standardized patterns etc.	E41_Appellation	0
E77_Persistent_Item	class	PersistentItem	Persistent Item	This class comprises items that have a persistent identity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. \nThey can be repeatedly recognized within the duration of their existence by identity criteria rather than by continuity or observation. Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.	E1_CRM_Entity	0
E78_Collection	class	Collection	Collection	This class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained ("curated" and "preserved", in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan.  \nItems may be added or removed from an E78 Collection in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Collection often referred to with the name of the E78 Collection (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”).\nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Collection. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.	E24_Physical_Man-Made_Thing	0
E79_Part_Addition	class	PartAddition	Part Addition	This class comprises activities that result in an instance of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing being increased, enlarged or augmented by the addition of a part. \nTypical scenarios include the attachment of an accessory, the integration of a component, the addition of an element to an aggregate object, or the accessioning of an object into a curated E78 Collection. Objects to which parts are added are, by definition, man-made, since the addition of a part implies a human activity. Following the addition of parts, the resulting man-made assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Collection over their lifespan.	E11_Modification	2
E80_Part_Removal	class	PartRemoval	Part Removal	This class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being decreased by the removal of a part.\nTypical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated E78 Collection. If the E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.	E11_Modification	2
E81_Transformation	class	Transformation	Transformation	This class comprises the events that result in the simultaneous destruction of one or more than one E77 Persistent Item and the creation of one or more than one E77 Persistent Item that preserves recognizable substance from the first one(s) but has fundamentally different nature and identity. \nAlthough the old and the new instances of E77 Persistent Item are treated as discrete entities having separate, unique identities, they are causally connected through the E81 Transformation; the destruction of the old E77 Persistent Item(s) directly causes the creation of the new one(s) using or preserving some relevant substance. Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history and the reorganization of a corporate body into a new one.	E63_Beginning_of_Existence|E64_End_of_Existence	1
E82_Actor_Appellation	class	ActorAppellation	Actor Appellation	This class comprises any sort of name, number, code or symbol characteristically used to identify an E39 Actor. \nAn E39 Actor will typically have more than one E82 Actor Appellation, and instances of E82 Actor Appellation in turn may have alternative representations. The distinction between corporate and personal names, which is particularly important in library applications, should be made by explicitly linking the E82 Actor Appellation to an instance of either E21 Person or E74 Group/E40 Legal Body. If this is not possible, the distinction can be made through the use of the P2 has type mechanism.	E41_Appellation	0
E83_Type_Creation	class	TypeCreation	Type Creation	This class comprises activities formally defining new types of items. \nIt is typically a rigorous scholarly or scientific process that ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named. In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “orgininal element” or “holotype”.	E65_Creation	0
E84_Information_Carrier	class	InformationCarrier	Information Carrier	This class comprises all instances of E22 Man-Made Object that are explicitly designed to act as persistent physical carriers for instances of E73 Information Object.\nAn E84 Information Carrier may or may not contain information, e.g., a diskette. Note that any E18 Physical Thing may carry information, such as an E34 Inscription. However, unless it was specifically designed for this purpose, it is not an Information Carrier. Therefore the property P128 carries (is carried by) applies to E18 Physical Thing in general.	E22_Man-Made_Object	0
E85_Joining	class	Joining	Joining	This class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E39 Actor becoming a member of an instance of E74 Group. This class does not imply initiative by either party. It may be the initiative of a third party.\nTypical scenarios include becoming a member of a social organisation, becoming employee of a company, marriage, the adoption of a child by a family and the inauguration of somebody into an official position.	E7_Activity	1
E86_Leaving	class	Leaving	Leaving	This class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E39 Actor to be disassociated from an instance of E74 Group. This class does not imply initiative by either party. It may be the initiative of a third party. \nTypical scenarios include the termination of membership in a social organisation, ending the employment at a company, divorce, and the end of tenure of somebody in an official position.	E7_Activity	1
E87_Curation_Activity	class	CurationActivity	Curation Activity	This class comprises the activities that result in the continuity of management and the preservation and evolution of instances of E78 Collection, following an implicit or explicit curation plan. \nIt specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of curation to be recorded.\nItems are accumulated and organized following criteria like subject, chronological period, material type, style of art etc. and can be added or removed from an E78 Collection for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items of a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event while the activity of evolving, preserving and promoting a collection is regarded as an instance of E87 Curation Activity.	E7_Activity	0
E89_Propositional_Object	class	PropositionalObject	Propositional Object	This class comprises immaterial items, including but not limited to stories, plots, procedural prescriptions, algorithms, laws of physics or images that are, or represent in some sense, sets of propositions about real or imaginary things and that are documented as single units or serve as topics of discourse. \n \nThis class also comprises items that are “about” something in the sense of a subject. In the wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and musical themes. However, conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E89 Propositional Object. This should not be confused with the definition of a type, which is indeed an instance of E89 Propositional Object.	E28_Conceptual_Object	1
E90_Symbolic_Object	class	SymbolicObject	Symbolic Object	This class comprises identifiable symbols and any aggregation of symbols, such as characters, identifiers, traffic signs, emblems, texts, data sets, images, musical scores, multimedia objects, computer program code or mathematical formulae that have an objectively recognizable structure and that are documented as single units.\n It includes sets of signs of any nature, which may serve to designate something, or to communicate some propositional content.\n An instance of E90 Symbolic Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. An instance of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary character string.\n In some cases, the content of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object may completely be represented by a serialized content model, such.. as the property P3 has note allows for describing this content model…P3.1 has type: E55 Type to specify the encoding..	E28_Conceptual_Object|E72_Legal_Object	0
E92_Spacetime_Volume	class	SpacetimeVolume	Spacetime Volume	This class comprises 4 dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime regardless its true geometric form. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. \n Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, Place and Timespan are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume.  An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. \n Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of a spacetime volume is trivially its projection on time.	E1_CRM_Entity	0
E93_Presence	class	Presence	Presence	This class comprises instances of E92 Spacetime Volume that result from intersection of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E52 Time-Span.  The identity of an instance of this class is determined by the identities of the  constituing spacetime volume and the time-span. \n \nThis class can be used to define temporal snapshots at a particular time-span, such as the extent of the Roman Empire at 33 B.C., or the extent occupied by a museum object at rest in an exhibit. In particular, it can be used to define the spatial projection of a spacetime volume during a particular time-span,  such as the maximal spatial extent of a flood at some particular hour, or all areas covered by the Poland within the 20th century AD.	E92_Spacetime_Volume	0
P1_is_identified_by	property	identified_by	is identified by	This property describes the naming or identification of any real world item by a name or any other identifier. \nThis property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.		E1_CRM_Entity	E41_Appellation	P1i_identifies	10	1	1

P2_has_type	property	classified_as	has type	This property allows sub typing of CRM entities - a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus. \nThe CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CRM may by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E51 Contact Point, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CRM hierarchy. Sub typing obviously requires consistency between the meaning of the terms assigned and the more general intent of the CRM entity in question.		E1_CRM_Entity	E55_Type	P2i_is_type_of	3	1	1

P3_has_note	property	note	has note	This property is a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed in terms of CRM constructs. \nIn particular it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance etc.\nLike property P2 has type (is type of), this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. “construction”, “decoration” etc. \nAn item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.		E1_CRM_Entity	rdfs:Literal		10000	0	0
P4_has_time-span	property	timespan	has time-span	This property describes the temporal confinement of an instance of an E2 Temporal Entity.\nThe related E52 Time-Span is understood as the real Time-Span during which the phenomena were active, which make up the temporal entity instance. It does not convey any other meaning than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The Time-Span in turn is approximated by a set of dates (E61 Time Primitive). A temporal entity can have in reality only one Time-Span, but there may exist alternative opinions about it, which we would express by assigning multiple Time-Spans. Related temporal entities may share a Time-Span. Time-Spans may have completely unknown dates but other descriptions by which we can infer knowledge.

P7_took_place_at	property	took_place_at	took place at	This property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period. \n\nThe related E53 Place should be seen as an approximation of the geographical area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred. P7took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (generally on the surface of the earth).  For example, the period "Révolution française" can be said to have taken place in “France”, the “Victorian” period, may be said to have taken place in “Britain” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and north America.\nA period can take place at multiple locations.\nIt is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place.

P16_used_specific_object	property	used_specific_object	used specific object	This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an E7 Activity. \nThis property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.\nAnother example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.	P12_occurred_in_the_presence_of	E7_Activity	E70_Thing	P16i_was_used_for	32	1	1

An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If  a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.\n\nThis property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.\n\nThe instances of E57 Material of which an item of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).

P49_has_former_or_current_keeper	property	former_or_current_keeper	has former or current keeper	This property identifies the E39 Actor or Actors who have or have had custody of an instance of E18 Physical Thing at\nsome time. This property leaves open the question if parts of this physical thing have\nbeen added or removed during the time-spans it has been under the custody of this\nactor, but it is required that at least a part which can unambiguously be identified as\nrepresenting the whole has been under this custody for its whole time. The way, in\nwhich a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps\na part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept\ninstance of E18 Physical Thing.\nThe distinction with P50 has current keeper (is current keeper of) is that P49 has former or current\nkeeper (is former or current keeper of) leaves open the question as to whether the specified keepers are\ncurrent.\nP49 has former or current keeper (is former or current keeper of) is a shortcut for the more detailed\npath from E18 Physical Thing through P30 transferred custody of (custody transferred through), E10\nTransfer of Custody, P28 custody surrendered by (surrendered custody through) or P29 custody\nreceived by (received custody through) to E39 Actor.

However, it indicates the E53 Place currently reserved for an object, such as the permanent storage location or a permanent exhibit location. The object may be temporarily removed from the permanent location, for example when used in temporary exhibitions or loaned to another institution. The object may never actually be located at its permanent location.		E19_Physical_Object	E53_Place	P54i_is_current_permanent_location_of	10000	0	0

P56_bears_feature	property	bears	bears feature	This property links an instance of E19 Physical Object to an instance of E26 Physical Feature that it bears.\nAn E26 Physical Feature can only exist on one object. One object may bear more than one E26 Physical Feature. An E27 Site should be considered as an E26 Physical Feature on the surface of the Earth.\nAn instance B of E26 Physical Feature being a detail of the structure of another instance A of E26 Physical Feature can be linked to B by use of the property P46 is composed of (forms part of). This implies that the subfeature B is P56i found on the same E19 Physical Object as A.\nP56 bears feature (is found on) is a shortcut. A more detailed representation can make use of the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path from E19 Physical Object through P59 has section (is located on or\nDefinition of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model 149 within), E53 Place, P53 has former or current location (is former or current location of) to E26 Physical Feature.

P57_has_number_of_parts	property	number_of_parts	has number of parts	This property documents the E60 Number of parts of which an instance of E19 Physical Object is composed.\nThis may be used as a method of checking inventory counts with regard to aggregate or collective objects. What constitutes a part or component depends on the context and requirements of the documentation. Normally, the parts documented in this way would not be considered as worthy of individual attention.\nFor a more complete description, objects may be decomposed into their components and constituents using P46 is composed of (forms parts of) and P45 consists of (is incorporated in). This allows each element to be described individually.		E19_Physical_Object	rdfs:Literal		10000	0	0
P58_has_section_definition	property	section_definition	has section definition	This property links an area (section) named by a E46 Section Definition to the instance of E18 Physical Thing upon which it is found.\nThe CRM handles sections as locations (instances of E53 Place) within or on E18 Physical Thing that are identified by E46 Section Definitions. Sections need not be discrete and separable components or parts of an object.\nThis is part of a more developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P58, E46 Section Definition, P87 is identified by (identifies) that allows a more precise definition of a location found on an object than the shortcut P59 has section (is located on or within).\nA particular instance of a Section Definition only applies to one instance of Physical Thing.

P65_shows_visual_item	property	shows	shows visual item	This property documents an E36 Visual Item shown by an instance of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing.\nThis property is similar to P62 depicts (is depicted by) in that it associates an item of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing with a visual representation. However, P65 shows visual item (is shown by) differs from the P62 depicts (is depicted by) property in that it makes no claims about what the E36 Visual Item is deemed to represent. E36 Visual Item identifies a recognisable image or visual symbol, regardless of what this image may or may not represent.\nFor example, all recent British coins bear a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, a fact that is correctly documented using P62 depicts (is depicted by). Different portraits have been used at different periods, however. P65 shows visual item (is shown by) can be used to refer to a particular portrait.\nP65 shows visual item (is shown by) may also be used for Visual Items such as signs, marks and symbols, for example the 'Maltese Cross' or the 'copyright symbol’ that have no particular representational content. \nThis property is part of the fully developed path from E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity which is shortcut by, P62 depicts (is depicted by).

P138.1 mode of representation allows the nature of the representation to be refined.\nThis property is also used for the relationship between an original and a digitisation of the original by the use of techniques such as digital photography, flatbed or infrared scanning. Digitisation is here seen as a process with a mechanical, causal component rendering the spatial distribution of structural and optical properties of the original and does not necessarily include any visual similarity identifiable by human observation.

The relationship is not transitive.\nThe equivalence applies to all cases of use of an instance of E41 Appellation. Multiple names assigned to an object, which are not equivalent for all things identified with a specific instance of E41 Appellation, should be modelled as repeated values of P1 is identified by (identifies). \nP139.1 has type allows the type of derivation, such as “transliteration from Latin 1 to ASCII” be refined..

P156_occupies	property	occupies	occupies	This property describes the largest volume in space that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied at any time during its existence, with respect to the reference space relative to itself. This allows you to describe the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26 Feature IsA E53 Place) may be a practical approach.\n\nFor instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. \n\nThis property is a subproperty of P161 has spatial projection because it refers to its own domain as reference space for its range, whereas P161 has spatial projection may refer to a place in terms of any reference space. For some instances of E18 Physical Object the relative stability of form may not be sufficient to define a useful local reference space, for instance for an amoeba. In such cases the fully developed path to an external reference space and using a temporal validity component may be adequate to determine the place they have occupied.\n\nIn contrast to P156  occupies, the property P53 has former or current location identifies an instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span.  Further it does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of P53 Place.	P161_has_spatial_projection	E18_Physical_Thing	E53_Place	P156i_is_occupied_by	10000	0	0

The relative stability of form of an E18 Physical Thing defines its default reference space. The reference space is not spatially limited to the referred thing. For example, a ship determines a reference space in terms of which other ships in its neighbourhood may be described. Larger constellations of matter, such as continental plates, may comprise many physical features that are at rest with them and define the same reference space.

P160_has_temporal_projection	property	temporal_projection	has temporal projection	This property describes the temporal projection of an instance of an E92 Spacetime Volume.

P161_has_spatial_projection	property	spatial_projection	has spatial projection	This property associates an instance of a E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E53 Place that is the result of the spatial projection of the instance of a E92 Spacetime Volume on a reference space. In general there can be more than one useful reference space to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, such as that of a battle ship versus that of the seafloor. Therefore the projection is not unique.\nThis is part of the fully developed path that is shortcut by P7took place at (witnessed).The more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place.

P165_incorporates	property	incorporates	incorporates	This property associates an instance of E73 Information Object with an instance of E90 Symbolic Object (or any of its subclasses) that was included in it.\nThis property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many distinct self-contained expressions, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.\nIt accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.\nIn particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.\nA digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of the manuscript page.

P168_place_is_defined_by	property	place_is_defined_by	place is defined by 	This property associates an instance of E53 Place with an instance of E94 Space Primitive that defines it. Syntactic variants or use of different scripts may result in multiple instances of E94 Space Primitive defining exactly the same place. Transformations between different reference systems in general result in new definitions of places approximating each other and not in alternative definitions. Note that it is possible for a place to be defined by phenomena causal to it or other forms of identification rather than by an instance of E94 Space Primitive. In this case, this property must not be used for approximating the respective instance of E53 Place with an instance of E94 Space Primitive.

E97_Monetary_Amount	class	MonetaryAmount	Monetary Amount	This class comprises quantities of monetary possessions or obligations in terms of their nominal value with respect to a particular currency. These quantities may be abstract accounting units, the nominal value of a heap of coins or bank notes at the time of validity of the respective currency, the nominal value of a bill of exchange or other documents expressing monetary claims or obligations	E54_Dimension	1
E98_Currency	class	Currency	Currency	This class comprises the units in which a monetary system, supported by an administrative authority or other community, quantifies and arithmetically compares all monetary amounts declared in the unit. The unit of a monetary system must describe a nominal value which is kept constant by its administrative authority and an associated banking system if it exists, and not by market value. For instance, one may pay with grams of gold, but the respective monetary amount would have been agreed as the gold price in US dollars on the day of the payment. Under this definition, British Pounds, U.S. Dollars, and European Euros are examples of currency, but “grams of gold” is not. One monetary system has one and only one currency. Instances of this class must not be confused with coin denominations, such as “Dime” or “Sestertius”. Non-monetary exchange of value in terms of quantities of a particular type of goods, such as cows, do not constitute a currency.	E55_Type	1
